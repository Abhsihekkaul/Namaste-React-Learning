<!-- do not put your package-lock.json file in .git-ignore file (so that your broser will stay updated with
 the version you are using to use the app )
 and put your node modules in your git ignore file (because it is quite heavy file and there is no meaning of putting such
 heavy file insid ethe git )  -->
 <!-- We just have to ship our package-lock.json and it will auto generate all the node_modules in our 
  browser where ever it needs it  -->


 <!-- how to set up parcel 
 
 1. npm init
 2. npm install -D parcel 

 it is not the appropriate way to keep the react using the cdn as we have to request to cdn everytime we are running 
 our application so in order to get rid of this we can install the react globally into our system using 

 3. npm install react
 we also have the shorthand for install as i 
 4. npm i react-dom

 now its time to ignite our app in order to do that we have to give the entry point to our app 
 5. npx parcel index.html


 in case you want to make everything production ready in the dist folder we can do
 6. npx parcel build index.html
 it will bundle everything together

 also we need to put parcel-cache inside our gitignore 

 once you are hitting enter make sure that you have your html and style.css file there in the project 
 here npx stands for execution with npm
