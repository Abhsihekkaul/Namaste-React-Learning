// why can't we make useEffect aysnc but component did mount async ?

// useEffect cannot be directly async because it expects a synchronous cleanup function or
//  nothing at all, not a promise.

// componentDidMount can be async because it's a regular class method and not constrained 
// by Reactâ€™s synchronous lifecycle expectations.
